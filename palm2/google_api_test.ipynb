There are many different sources of AI and data news, such as news websites, blogs, and social media. You can choose one or more sources that you want to collect news from.\\n2. Create a dashboard. There are many different dashboarding tools available, such as Google Data Studio, Power BI, and Tableau. Choose a tool that you are comfortable using and that can meet your needs.\\n3. Create a data source connection. Once you have chosen a dashboarding tool, you need to create a data source connection to the news sources that you want to collect news from. This will allow the dashboard to pull in the latest news from those sources.\\n4. Create a dashboard layout. Once you have created a data source connection, you can start creating a dashboard layout. This will include adding charts, graphs, and other visuals to the dashboard.\\n5. Add news sources. Once you have created a dashboard layout, you can start adding news sources to the dashboard. This will allow the dashboard to pull in the latest news from those sources.\\n6. Add filters. You can also add filters to the dashboard to control which news is displayed. This can be useful if you want to focus on a specific topic or region.\\n7. Share the dashboard. Once you have created a dashboard, you can share it with others. This can be done by publishing the dashboard or by sharing a link to the dashboard.\\n\\nHere are some additional tips for creating a successful AI and data news project:\\n\\n* Choose a data source that is reliable and up-to-date.\\n* Create a dashboard that is easy to use and understand.\\n* Add filters to the dashboard to control which news is displayed.\\n* Share the dashboard with others to get feedback and improve the project.'"
